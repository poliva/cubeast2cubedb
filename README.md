Chrome extension to export your [Cubeast](https://app.cubeast.com) solves to [CubeDB](https://www.cubedb.net).

To use the extension you can follow these steps:

- Open Google Chrome and navigate to the extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
- Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner of the extensions page.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the extensions page.
- Select the folder containing the files in this repository.

Once the extension is loaded, navigate to the [Cubeast website](https://app.cubeast.com/), choose a solve and click on the "solution" tab where you can see your moves, then click the extension's browser action button. This will open CubeDB on a new browser tab with the scramble and the solution of the Cubeast puzzle. You can then use the "Solve Critique" feature of CubeDB to analyse your solve.

Here's an example solve that showcases this extension at the end of the video:
